# T-041: Hold enforced on podvm units (pod-hold or pod-sud) (GitHub #41)

**Source:** GitHub #41
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

The text of GitHub #41 ("Hold `enforced` on podvm units (`pod-hold` or `pod-sud`)"), cleaned:

**What and why.** The hold says how the network traffic of a unit reaches the egress broker: `none`, `advisory` (a seccomp redirect that a payload can go around), or `enforced`. The `untrusted` tier needs `enforced`. A podvm unit on a no-root host reaches `advisory` at most today (through `podnet pod`). With an `enforced` hold on podvm units, podrunner can serve more than `trusted` jobs at `advisory` there, and the fixed denies of the broker hold.

**Dependencies in other repositories.**

- PodUtils/podcrates@T-109 (hold research) decides the crate (`pod-hold` or `pod-sud`). The hold reports a level and a proof. podcrates ask: PodUtils/podvm#227, section 2.7.
- podnet said in PodUtils/podnet#414 that the import of the generic hold comes after its backend split (PodUtils/podnet@T-040) and seccomp fixes (PodUtils/podnet@T-142 to PodUtils/podnet@T-158). Those entries look done. podnet ask: PodUtils/podvm#228, section 2.9.

**Content (podrunner side).** The podvm driver (#23) reports `egress_hold: enforced` with its proof when the crate gives one; placement (#21) and egress (#24) read it. No change to the seam contract (#16): `egress_hold` exists already.

**Acceptance.**

- PodUtils/podcrates@T-109 names the crate and its proof form.
- The podvm driver reports `enforced` with a proof only where the crate proves it, and a test plants a false claim that fails.

Later than v1: no milestone. Dependencies: PodUtils/podvm#227 section 2.7 (PodUtils/podcrates@T-109), PodUtils/podvm#228 section 2.9. Estimate (mine): S on the podrunner side.

## Premise

Read the text of GitHub #41 on 2026-11-11. Measured on 2026-11-11 with `scripts/measure-podnet-pod.sh` (podvm `v0.2.0-beta.3`, podnet `v0.4.0-beta.3`): as root (the namespace rung, `hold.netns` `enforced`), `BACKEND=netns` holds the payload after `podnet pod` returns, and a direct connect of the payload or of a held exec to the loopback of the host fails (curl exit 7); as uid 65534 with no user namespace, `seccomp` lets both through.

## Approach

`pod-hold` is in podcrates `v0.24.0`: the seccomp hold (`advisory`) and the netns hold (`enforced`: a new network namespace in a new user namespace, its only route a TUN that the supervisor holds). The netns hold needs unprivileged user namespaces and `/dev/net/tun`, so H0 gets `advisory` at most; a host with user namespaces (the namespace rung of podvm) can get `enforced`. Measure `podnet pod --backend netns` around `podvm run -d` on such a host; when it holds, the podvm driver reports `egress_hold: enforced` with the proof of `pod doctor --json` (`hold.netns`), and a test plants a false claim that fails.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-podvm hold`, and `cargo test -p podrunner-podvm --test hold -- --ignored` as root and as a uid with no user namespace

## Start condition

T-065 is done: the podvm driver runs its units under `podnet pod` with the `advisory` hold.

## Done

2026-11-11, `349f0ba`: `with_podnet` takes the backend `netns` (`egress_hold: enforced`) when `podnet pod doctor --json` says `hold.netns` `enforced`, else `seccomp` (`advisory` at most, also when it claims more: the plant of `the_hold_comes_from_pod_doctor`). The hold test checks the claim: a direct loopback connect of the payload reaches the host only under `advisory`. It passes as root (netns) and as uid 65534 under `nouserns` (seccomp). Gate run 43076066364 and runner-image run 43076066444 (the hold test) of `e5bdddb` are green.

# T-042: The confined boundary (pod-confine) (GitHub #42)

**Source:** GitHub #42
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

The text of GitHub #42 ("`confined` boundary (`pod-confine`)"), cleaned:

**What and why.** The boundary order is `none` < `redirect` < `confined` < `guest`. `redirect` rewrites file paths and is not isolation against hostile code; every podvm rung is `redirect`. `confined` is a kernel-enforced boundary with no root (Landlock, seccomp, rlimits). With it, `trusted` jobs run on a no-root host above `redirect` (DR-4, #4).

**Dependencies in other repositories.** PodUtils/podcrates@T-108 (`pod-confine`) gives a capability record with `boundary: confined` and a proof string. podcrates ask: PodUtils/podvm#227, section 2.7.

**Content (podrunner side).** A unit kind or a podvm driver option that reports `boundary: confined` with the proof of PodUtils/podcrates@T-108. The capability schema (#17) and placement (#21) take `confined` already.

**Acceptance.**

- A unit reports `confined` only with a proof from `pod-confine`, and a planted false claim fails.
- A `trusted` job runs on a `confined` unit when the operator keeps the default floor (DR-4 allows `redirect` only as a choice).

Later than v1: no milestone. Dependencies: PodUtils/podvm#227 section 2.7 (PodUtils/podcrates@T-108). Estimate (mine): -.

## Premise

Read the text of GitHub #42 on 2026-11-11. Nothing measured.

## Approach

A unit kind with `boundary: confined` and the proof of `pod-confine`.

Done (podcrates `v0.24.0`): `crates/podrunner-unit/src/confine.rs` builds the rules of a unit (read and execute the system directories, read `/proc`, read and write the unit root, a few devices; the default deny list of `pod-confine`). The shim applies them in the payload between the fork and the exec (`shim::under_shim_confined`); a refusal of the kernel fails the spawn. `FakeUnit::confined` gives a fake of `boundary: confined` with the proof `pod-confine: landlock abi N`. Conformance test 27 (`a-confined-unit-reads-no-other-root`) passes on it, and its plant (the record claims `confined`, no rule applies) fails it. With podcrates `v0.25.0`, `apply` drops each capability that the mask does not name, so the test also runs as root (T-073). With `v0.27.0`, `for_unit` also gives the socket directory of the unit a read and write rule: from Landlock ABI 9 a connect to a Unix socket made outside the domain needs it (`a_confined_payload_reaches_the_sockets_of_its_unit`).

Open: a unit kind for real jobs. The podvm driver says `confined` when podvm applies `pod-confine` in its units (PodUtils/podvm#259) and test 27 passes on it.

pmask (the owner's note to DR-6, not adopted) is no boundary and gives no `confined`. As a later launcher option behind `UnitDriver` it can hide the command line and the environment of a job from the other jobs of a shared uid. It needs ptrace: measure `pmask probe` on the host first.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-unit confined`

## Done

2026-11-12, `660bdf1`; gate run 43155326553, level2 run 43155326441 and runner-image run 43155326439 of `660bdf1` are green. The podvm kind with `confine = true` reports `boundary: confined` only after its self-test (T-079); the confined fake and pod-confine of podcrates `v0.27.0` stay for the fake kind, with the socket directory of the unit (`3ef4db9`). A trusted job runs on the confined podvm unit: the canned job and the container job of `crates/podrunner-broker-fake/tests/podvm.rs` pass under the layer in `runner-image.yml`.

# T-043: Later crates: service unit, release index, acceptance registry (GitHub #43)

**Source:** GitHub #43
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** blocked

## Problem

The text of GitHub #43 ("Later crates: service unit, release index, acceptance registry"), cleaned:

**What and why.** Three podcrates entries serve podrunner after v1. None is on the path of v1.

- `pod-unit` (PodUtils/podcrates@T-102): a service unit for a hosted `podrunner` service. Until then `podrunner print-unit` (#22) writes the unit.
- `pod-release` (PodUtils/podcrates@T-104): signed release indexes (cfb ask A-X-13). Until then #15 publishes betas with SHA-256 sums and a build provenance attestation.
- `pod-todo` registry (PodUtils/podcrates@T-105): the "Proves" column as a registry of acceptance (cfb ask A-X-14). Until then the record of #13 maps each issue to an entry.

**Acceptance.**

- When each entry is released, an issue here takes it, or this issue records why not.

Later than v1: no milestone. Dependencies: PodUtils/podcrates@T-102, PodUtils/podcrates@T-104, PodUtils/podcrates@T-105 (entries exist; no new ask). Estimate (mine): -.

## Premise

Read the text of GitHub #43 on 2026-11-11. Nothing measured.

## Approach

Take each crate when podcrates releases it.

## Prove

`cargo test --workspace`

## Blocker

podcrates builds the crates (PodUtils/podvm#227, section 2.7); none is planned for v1.

# T-046: Local mode: podrunner run workflow.yml (GitHub #48)

**Source:** GitHub #48
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** L
**Status:** open

## Problem

The text of GitHub #48 ("Local mode: podrunner run workflow.yml"), cleaned:

The owner answered podcrates Q11 yes on 2026-11-11: "yes plan it". A local mode runs a workflow file on the host, as nektos/act does, with no forge.

**Shape** (from the study of the owner's archive `ghactions-local`, PodUtils/podcrates:docs/research/ci/ghactions-local.md):

- A `local` job source compiles the workflow (`pod-actions-workflow`, `pod-actions-expr`) into job offers.
- The official runner takes each job offline through the fake broker of #38, in a podvm unit (M-B, #26).
- `pod-actions-exec` comes later, for targets with no official runner.
- An artifacts and cache service is necessary (a crate or a module: to decide).
- runner.server (MIT, .NET, not static) fits only as a payload in a unit, on loopback only.

**Defects of the archive's conformance suite to fix before use:** w6 needs an `app.js` that is missing; markers can match the echoed script (w4, w5, w7): print computed markers and match output lines only; `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)` removes each container of the host; images and actions are pinned by tags that move (pin by digest and by commit); the scripts carry no licence (ask the owner before a copy).

**Acceptance.** `podrunner run workflow.yml` runs a pinned workflow suite to green on a podvm unit, with no network other than the egress module.

## Premise

Read GitHub #48 and the podcrates study note of 2026-11-11. Nothing built, nothing measured.

## Approach

A third source kind, `local`, behind `JobSource` (the source conformance suite applies), that reads one workflow file and offers its jobs at tier `local` (call C14). The unit is the podvm unit of T-026 with the fake broker of T-038 as the Actions service. Fix the suite defects above before a copy.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-source local`

## Start condition

Met on 2026-11-12: podcrates `v0.30.0` (T-086) has `pod-actions-workflow` and `pod-actions-expr` (PodUtils/podcrates@T-251, calls C105 to C109 of podcrates). Its PodUtils/podcrates@T-280 (a live run of their vectors against GitHub) is open, so the expansion of a matrix (C107, C108) is not measured against the official runner.

# T-073: Take the podcrates tag after v0.24.0: pod-confine drops each capability

**Source:** PodUtils/podcrates@T-221
**Category:** chore
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

Root keeps `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_PERFMON`, which pass Landlock for an unconfined ancestor, so the confine test of `crates/podrunner-unit/src/confine.rs` has a root guard. The next tag of podcrates changes `pod-confine`: `apply` drops each capability, and `Spec` gets new fields (scope, udp; podrunner uses the builders).

## Premise

Read the answer of podcrates (PodUtils/podcrates@T-221) on 2026-11-11. Not in `v0.24.0`.

## Approach

Move each `pod-*` dependency of `Cargo.toml` to the new tag, build, remove the root guard of the confine test, and run conformance test 27 as root and as a user.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-unit confined`, as root and as a user.

## Done

2026-11-11, `02a1c0b`: each `pod-*` dependency is at podcrates `v0.25.0` (COORD-051, PodUtils/podcrates#76); the build needs no change of code. The root guard of the confine test is gone: `cargo test -p podrunner-unit confined` passes as root and as uid 65534.
