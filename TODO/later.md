# T-041: Hold enforced on podvm units (pod-hold or pod-sud) (GitHub #41)

**Source:** GitHub #41
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

The text of GitHub #41 ("Hold `enforced` on podvm units (`pod-hold` or `pod-sud`)"), cleaned:

**What and why.** The hold says how the network traffic of a unit reaches the egress broker: `none`, `advisory` (a seccomp redirect that a payload can go around), or `enforced`. The `untrusted` tier needs `enforced`. A podvm unit on a no-root host reaches `advisory` at most today (through `podnet pod`). With an `enforced` hold on podvm units, podrunner can serve more than `trusted` jobs at `advisory` there, and the fixed denies of the broker hold.

**Dependencies in other repositories.**

- PodUtils/podcrates@T-109 (hold research) decides the crate (`pod-hold` or `pod-sud`). The hold reports a level and a proof. podcrates ask: PodUtils/podvm#227, section 2.7.
- podnet said in PodUtils/podnet#414 that the import of the generic hold comes after its backend split (PodUtils/podnet@T-040) and seccomp fixes (PodUtils/podnet@T-142 to PodUtils/podnet@T-158). Those entries look done. podnet ask: PodUtils/podvm#228, section 2.9.

**Content (podrunner side).** The podvm driver (#23) reports `egress_hold: enforced` with its proof when the crate gives one; placement (#21) and egress (#24) read it. No change to the seam contract (#16): `egress_hold` exists already.

**Acceptance.**

- PodUtils/podcrates@T-109 names the crate and its proof form.
- The podvm driver reports `enforced` with a proof only where the crate proves it, and a test plants a false claim that fails.

Later than v1: no milestone. Dependencies: PodUtils/podvm#227 section 2.7 (PodUtils/podcrates@T-109), PodUtils/podvm#228 section 2.9. Estimate (mine): S on the podrunner side.

## Premise

Read the text of GitHub #41 on 2026-11-11. Measured on 2026-11-11 with `scripts/measure-podnet-pod.sh` (podvm `v0.2.0-beta.3`, podnet `v0.4.0-beta.3`): as root (the namespace rung, `hold.netns` `enforced`), `BACKEND=netns` holds the payload after `podnet pod` returns, and a direct connect of the payload or of a held exec to the loopback of the host fails (curl exit 7); as uid 65534 with no user namespace, `seccomp` lets both through.

## Approach

`pod-hold` is in podcrates `v0.24.0`: the seccomp hold (`advisory`) and the netns hold (`enforced`: a new network namespace in a new user namespace, its only route a TUN that the supervisor holds). The netns hold needs unprivileged user namespaces and `/dev/net/tun`, so H0 gets `advisory` at most; a host with user namespaces (the namespace rung of podvm) can get `enforced`. Measure `podnet pod --backend netns` around `podvm run -d` on such a host; when it holds, the podvm driver reports `egress_hold: enforced` with the proof of `pod doctor --json` (`hold.netns`), and a test plants a false claim that fails.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-podvm hold`, and `cargo test -p podrunner-podvm --test hold -- --ignored` as root and as a uid with no user namespace

## Start condition

T-065 is done: the podvm driver runs its units under `podnet pod` with the `advisory` hold.

## Done

2026-11-11, `349f0ba`: `with_podnet` takes the backend `netns` (`egress_hold: enforced`) when `podnet pod doctor --json` says `hold.netns` `enforced`, else `seccomp` (`advisory` at most, also when it claims more: the plant of `the_hold_comes_from_pod_doctor`). The hold test checks the claim: a direct loopback connect of the payload reaches the host only under `advisory`. It passes as root (netns) and as uid 65534 under `nouserns` (seccomp). Gate run 43076066364 and runner-image run 43076066444 (the hold test) of `e5bdddb` are green.

# T-042: The confined boundary (pod-confine) (GitHub #42)

**Source:** GitHub #42
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

The text of GitHub #42 ("`confined` boundary (`pod-confine`)"), cleaned:

**What and why.** The boundary order is `none` < `redirect` < `confined` < `guest`. `redirect` rewrites file paths and is not isolation against hostile code; every podvm rung is `redirect`. `confined` is a kernel-enforced boundary with no root (Landlock, seccomp, rlimits). With it, `trusted` jobs run on a no-root host above `redirect` (DR-4, #4).

**Dependencies in other repositories.** PodUtils/podcrates@T-108 (`pod-confine`) gives a capability record with `boundary: confined` and a proof string. podcrates ask: PodUtils/podvm#227, section 2.7.

**Content (podrunner side).** A unit kind or a podvm driver option that reports `boundary: confined` with the proof of PodUtils/podcrates@T-108. The capability schema (#17) and placement (#21) take `confined` already.

**Acceptance.**

- A unit reports `confined` only with a proof from `pod-confine`, and a planted false claim fails.
- A `trusted` job runs on a `confined` unit when the operator keeps the default floor (DR-4 allows `redirect` only as a choice).

Later than v1: no milestone. Dependencies: PodUtils/podvm#227 section 2.7 (PodUtils/podcrates@T-108). Estimate (mine): -.

## Premise

Read the text of GitHub #42 on 2026-11-11. Nothing measured.

## Approach

A unit kind with `boundary: confined` and the proof of `pod-confine`.

Done (podcrates `v0.24.0`): `crates/podrunner-unit/src/confine.rs` builds the rules of a unit (read and execute the system directories, read `/proc`, read and write the unit root, a few devices; the default deny list of `pod-confine`). The shim applies them in the payload between the fork and the exec (`shim::under_shim_confined`); a refusal of the kernel fails the spawn. `FakeUnit::confined` gives a fake of `boundary: confined` with the proof `pod-confine: landlock abi N`. Conformance test 27 (`a-confined-unit-reads-no-other-root`) passes on it, and its plant (the record claims `confined`, no rule applies) fails it. With podcrates `v0.25.0`, `apply` drops each capability that the mask does not name, so the test also runs as root (T-073). With `v0.27.0`, `for_unit` also gives the socket directory of the unit a read and write rule: from Landlock ABI 9 a connect to a Unix socket made outside the domain needs it (`a_confined_payload_reaches_the_sockets_of_its_unit`).

Open: a unit kind for real jobs. The podvm driver says `confined` when podvm applies `pod-confine` in its units (PodUtils/podvm#259) and test 27 passes on it.

pmask (the owner's note to DR-6, not adopted) is no boundary and gives no `confined`. As a later launcher option behind `UnitDriver` it can hide the command line and the environment of a job from the other jobs of a shared uid. It needs ptrace: measure `pmask probe` on the host first.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-unit confined`

## Done

2026-11-12, `660bdf1`; gate run 43155326553, level2 run 43155326441 and runner-image run 43155326439 of `660bdf1` are green. The podvm kind with `confine = true` reports `boundary: confined` only after its self-test (T-079); the confined fake and pod-confine of podcrates `v0.27.0` stay for the fake kind, with the socket directory of the unit (`3ef4db9`). A trusted job runs on the confined podvm unit: the canned job and the container job of `crates/podrunner-broker-fake/tests/podvm.rs` pass under the layer in `runner-image.yml`.

# T-043: Later crates: service unit, release index, acceptance registry (GitHub #43)

**Source:** GitHub #43
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** blocked

## Problem

The text of GitHub #43 ("Later crates: service unit, release index, acceptance registry"), cleaned:

**What and why.** Three podcrates entries serve podrunner after v1. None is on the path of v1.

- `pod-unit` (PodUtils/podcrates@T-102): a service unit for a hosted `podrunner` service. Until then `podrunner print-unit` (#22) writes the unit.
- `pod-release` (PodUtils/podcrates@T-104): signed release indexes (cfb ask A-X-13). Until then #15 publishes betas with SHA-256 sums and a build provenance attestation.
- `pod-todo` registry (PodUtils/podcrates@T-105): the "Proves" column as a registry of acceptance (cfb ask A-X-14). Until then the record of #13 maps each issue to an entry.

**Acceptance.**

- When each entry is released, an issue here takes it, or this issue records why not.

Later than v1: no milestone. Dependencies: PodUtils/podcrates@T-102, PodUtils/podcrates@T-104, PodUtils/podcrates@T-105 (entries exist; no new ask). Estimate (mine): -.

## Premise

Read the text of GitHub #43 on 2026-11-11. Nothing measured.

## Approach

Take each crate when podcrates releases it.

## Prove

`cargo test --workspace`

## Blocker

podcrates builds the crates (PodUtils/podvm#227, section 2.7); none is planned for v1.

# T-046: Local mode: podrunner run workflow.yml (GitHub #48)

**Source:** GitHub #48
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** L
**Status:** partial

## Problem

The text of GitHub #48 ("Local mode: podrunner run workflow.yml"), cleaned:

The owner answered podcrates Q11 yes on 2026-11-11: "yes plan it". A local mode runs a workflow file on the host, as nektos/act does, with no forge.

**Shape** (from the study of the owner's archive `ghactions-local`, PodUtils/podcrates:docs/research/ci/ghactions-local.md):

- A `local` job source compiles the workflow (`pod-actions-workflow`, `pod-actions-expr`) into job offers.
- The official runner takes each job offline through the fake broker of #38, in a podvm unit (M-B, #26).
- `pod-actions-exec` comes later, for targets with no official runner.
- An artifacts and cache service is necessary (a crate or a module: to decide).
- runner.server (MIT, .NET, not static) fits only as a payload in a unit, on loopback only.

**Defects of the archive's conformance suite to fix before use:** w6 needs an `app.js` that is missing; markers can match the echoed script (w4, w5, w7): print computed markers and match output lines only; `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)` removes each container of the host; images and actions are pinned by tags that move (pin by digest and by commit); the scripts carry no licence (ask the owner before a copy).

**Acceptance.** `podrunner run workflow.yml` runs a pinned workflow suite to green on a podvm unit, with no network other than the egress module.

## Premise

Read GitHub #48 and the podcrates study note of 2026-11-11. Nothing built, nothing measured.

## Approach

A third source kind, `local`, behind `JobSource` (the source conformance suite applies), that reads one workflow file and offers its jobs at tier `local` (call C14). The unit is the podvm unit of T-026 with the fake broker of T-038 as the Actions service. Fix the suite defects above before a copy.

## Decision

2026-11-12: the work is three entries, in this order. T-087: the `local` source (`crates/podrunner-local`), a workflow file into offers and job results, with the source conformance suite. T-088: a workflow job into the job message of the fake broker; the runner evaluates the expressions of the steps from the context data (`matrix`, `strategy`, `needs`, `vars`, `inputs`, `env`). T-089: `podrunner run workflow.yml`, the source, the fake broker and a unit end to end, with a pinned suite (the defects of the archive's suite fixed). A `uses:` step (an action) needs a copy of the action: T-089 names that gap. This entry closes with T-089. Changed on 2026-11-12: T-089 runs the jobs on a runner directory; T-090 runs each job in a podvm unit and closes this entry; T-091 gives actions.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-source local`

## Start condition

Met on 2026-11-12: podcrates `v0.30.0` (T-086) has `pod-actions-workflow` and `pod-actions-expr` (PodUtils/podcrates@T-251, calls C105 to C109 of podcrates). Its PodUtils/podcrates@T-280 (a live run of their vectors against GitHub) is open, so the expansion of a matrix (C107, C108) is not measured against the official runner.

# T-073: Take the podcrates tag after v0.24.0: pod-confine drops each capability

**Source:** PodUtils/podcrates@T-221
**Category:** chore
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** done

## Problem

Root keeps `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_PERFMON`, which pass Landlock for an unconfined ancestor, so the confine test of `crates/podrunner-unit/src/confine.rs` has a root guard. The next tag of podcrates changes `pod-confine`: `apply` drops each capability, and `Spec` gets new fields (scope, udp; podrunner uses the builders).

## Premise

Read the answer of podcrates (PodUtils/podcrates@T-221) on 2026-11-11. Not in `v0.24.0`.

## Approach

Move each `pod-*` dependency of `Cargo.toml` to the new tag, build, remove the root guard of the confine test, and run conformance test 27 as root and as a user.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-unit confined`, as root and as a user.

## Done

2026-11-11, `02a1c0b`: each `pod-*` dependency is at podcrates `v0.25.0` (COORD-051, PodUtils/podcrates#76); the build needs no change of code. The root guard of the confine test is gone: `cargo test -p podrunner-unit confined` passes as root and as uid 65534.

# T-087: The local source: a workflow file into job offers and job results

**Source:** T-046
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M
**Status:** done

## Problem

The local mode (T-046) needs a job source of kind `local` that reads one workflow file and offers its jobs. The order of the jobs comes from `needs`; a job with a matrix is one offer for each cell; a job whose `if:` is false ends as skipped, with its reason. The result of each job decides the jobs after it (`needs.<id>.result`, `success()`, `failure()`).

## Premise

Read `pod-actions-workflow` and `pod-actions-expr` of podcrates `v0.30.0` on 2026-11-12: `parse`, `Run::new`, `ready`, `expand` (into `Instance` cells or a `Skip`), `finish` with `Done`, `JobResult::combine`. `Run` borrows its `Workflow`. Nothing built.

## Approach

A crate `podrunner-local` with `LocalSource`: `JobSource` over a `Run`. `next` expands each ready job; each cell is one offer (job id `JOB.N`, the labels of `runs-on`, tier `local` by the source set, call C14). `complete(job_id, result, outputs)` records the end of a cell; when each cell of a job ended, the job finishes with the combined result, and the jobs after it become ready. `mint` gives the credential of a minter that the caller sets (T-089: the files of the fake broker). The source conformance suite runs on a workflow of two jobs.

## Prove

`cargo test -p podrunner-local`: the conformance suite, the order of `needs`, a matrix, a skip with its reason, and the result of a failed need.

## Done

2026-11-12. `crates/podrunner-local`: `LocalSource` passes the 12 tests of the source conformance suite on a workflow of two jobs; podrunner-local: 7 passed. The tests hold the labels of `runs-on`, one offer for each cell of a matrix, a job that waits for each cell of its need, a skip with its condition (`failure()` has no implicit `success() &&`), a failed cell that fails its job and runs the job of `failure()`, and the outputs of a job in `needs` of the next. A plant that finishes a job at its first cell fails two tests. `Run` borrows its workflow, so each source leaks one workflow; podcrates has the ask of a `Run` that owns it.

# T-088: A workflow job into the job message of the fake broker

**Source:** T-046
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M
**Status:** done

## Problem

The official runner takes a job message (`AgentJobRequestMessage`) from the fake broker. The message of `crates/podrunner-broker-fake/src/message.rs` carries plain `run:` scripts with no context. A workflow job has `env`, `defaults.run`, step `shell`, `working-directory`, `id`, `if:`, `continue-on-error`, and `${{ }}` in each of them. GitHub sends expressions as tokens, and the runner evaluates them in its contexts (`matrix`, `strategy`, `needs`, `vars`, `inputs`, `steps`, `env`, `runner`, `job`).

## Premise

Read the message builder of the fake broker on 2026-11-12: steps are script actions with a literal script, `contextData` holds only `github`. Not measured: the token forms that runner v2.338.2 takes for a basic expression and for a text with expressions.

## Approach

Build the step inputs and the environment as template tokens (a literal string, or a basic expression; a text with expressions as `format()`), and put `matrix`, `strategy`, `needs`, `vars` and `inputs` into `contextData`. Measure each form with the official runner offline (`tests/runner.rs`). A `uses:` step is refused by name until T-089 gives actions.

## Prove

`PODRUNNER_RUNNER_DIR=DIR cargo test -p podrunner-local --test runner -- --ignored`: a job with a matrix, an env with an expression, a step `if:` on `steps.X.outputs`, and `needs.X.outputs` give the values of GitHub.

## Done

2026-11-12. `crates/podrunner-local/src/message.rs` makes the job of the fake broker: each step a script action (its id or `__run`, `__run_2` as its context name, `shell` and `working-directory` with `defaults.run`, `env`, `continue-on-error`, `timeout-minutes`); a text with `${{ }}` is a basic expression, or `format()` with escaped literal text; the env of the workflow and of the job, and `jobOutputs`, as tokens; `matrix`, `strategy`, `needs`, `vars` and `inputs` in `contextData`. The fake broker takes these as `Job::overrides`, keeps the job outputs of `completejob`, and gives a step condition with a status function no implicit `success() &&` (`a_status_function_gets_no_implicit_success` fails on the old rule: `success() && (always())`). The official runner v2.338.2 runs the test workflow offline (1 passed): the matrix, the env of the workflow and of the job, a step output in an `if:` and in an `env`, the job output, `needs.build.outputs.out` and `needs.build.result`; the step of `failure()` does not run. A plant with no `matrix` in the context data fails the test. podrunner-local: 12 passed; level2 run 43200349015 of `903d55d` runs it green. `uses:`, `container:` and `services:` are refused by name (T-089).

# T-089: podrunner run workflow.yml: the local mode end to end

**Source:** T-046
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M
**Status:** done

## Problem

The acceptance of T-046: `podrunner run workflow.yml` runs a pinned workflow suite to green on a podvm unit, with no network other than the egress module.

## Premise

T-087 and T-088 give the source and the messages; the fake broker (T-038), the podvm unit (T-026) and the slots exist. Nothing built for the command.

## Approach

A subcommand that builds a source set of kind `local` from the file, starts one fake broker, mints the runner files of the broker for each claimed job, runs each job in a unit of the configured kind, and reads its result from the broker. A `uses:` step needs its action: a local copy (a directory or a pinned archive) first; a fetch through the egress module later. The pinned suite fixes the defects of the archive's suite (T-046).

## Prove

`podrunner run tests/local/suite.yml` passes on the fake unit in the gate, and on a podvm unit in `runner-image.yml`.

## Correction

2026-11-12: the fake unit runs no official runner, so the Prove on "the fake unit in the gate" cannot hold. The command runs on a runner directory (tier `local`) in level 2; the run in a podvm unit and the acceptance of T-046 are T-090; actions are T-091. The suite is `crates/podrunner/tests/local/suite.yml`.

## Done

2026-11-12. `podrunner run FILE --runner-dir DIR [--event NAME] [--var NAME=VALUE]... [--input NAME=VALUE]...` (`crates/podrunner/src/run_local.rs`): `podrunner_local::drive` takes each offer of the local source, runs it with an executor (`exec::RunnerDir`: the official runner in DIR against a fake broker on the loopback, one job at a time), and records its end; a job that cannot become a message (an action, a container) fails with its reason; one line for each job (`ok`, `failure`, `skipped` with its condition); exit 0, 1 when a job failed, or the code of the class (usage, not found, config). The key of the runner is a new RSA key in Rust (`rsa` 0.9.10, key generation only; `deny.toml` ignores RUSTSEC-2023-0071 with the reason), each number at the length that .NET takes (the old helper stripped leading zero bytes: a short `d` about once in 256 keys). `PODRUNNER_RUNNER_DIR=DIR cargo test -p podrunner --test local -- --ignored` runs `crates/podrunner/tests/local/suite.yml` to green on runner v2.338.2 here: a matrix with `include` and `exclude` (4 cells), job outputs into `needs`, `defaults.run`, a step `working-directory` and `shell`, `continue-on-error` with `outcome` and `conclusion`, `failure()` and `always()` steps, a skipped job with its reason, and a job after it with `always()`. A plant with no `strategy` context fails the 4 cells. podrunner-local: 15 passed; `run_local`: 4 passed. Level 2 runs the suite.

# T-090: podrunner run: each job of the local mode in a fresh podvm unit

**Source:** T-089
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

The acceptance of T-046: `podrunner run workflow.yml` runs a pinned workflow suite to green on a podvm unit, with no network other than the egress module. T-089 runs the jobs on a runner directory of the host, as the user of podrunner, with no unit and no egress hold.

## Premise

T-089 gives the loop (`podrunner_local::drive`) and the trait `Executor`. `crates/podrunner-broker-fake/tests/podvm.rs` runs a canned job in a podvm unit with the runner image (T-026). Not built: an executor over `UnitDriver`, the reach of the fake broker from the unit, the egress module.

## Approach

`exec::Unit`: an executor over a `UnitDriver` (podvm first): prepare the runner image, start a unit with the runner files of the broker for the job, wait, read the result from the broker, destroy, and refuse a run with residue. The command takes `--podvm PATH --images STORE --image REF` in place of `--runner-dir`. The broker listens where the unit reaches it (the loopback of a shared network now; the egress module with `[unit.podvm] podnet` after).

## Prove

`runner-image.yml` runs `podrunner run crates/podrunner/tests/local/suite.yml --podvm ... --image ...` to green on x86_64, each job in its own unit, with no residue.

# T-091: Actions (uses:) in the local mode

**Source:** T-089
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** later
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

A step with `uses:` (an action: `actions/checkout`, a JavaScript, composite or Docker action) fails in the local mode with "an action is not supported yet". Most workflows use `actions/checkout` and some JavaScript actions. The archive's suite pins actions by tags that move (T-046).

## Premise

The job message of T-088 has script steps only. The runner downloads an action through the action service of the broker (`actionDownloadInfo`), and takes a cached action from its `_work/_actions` directory. Not measured: the routes of the action service that runner v2.338.2 calls, and the cache layout.

## Approach

Give the runner each action from a local copy: a directory or an archive pinned by commit, named in a file of the run, served by the fake broker as the download of the action (or put into `_actions`). `actions/checkout` of the local tree first; a fetch through the egress module later. Refuse an action that is not pinned by a full commit id.

## Prove

The local suite gets a job with `actions/checkout` pinned by commit and a JavaScript action from a local copy; `podrunner run` runs it to green in level 2.
